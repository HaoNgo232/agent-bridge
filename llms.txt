# Agent Bridge - Project Context

## Purpose
A specialized tool to bridge the gap between Antigravity (Markdown-based) agents and various AI IDE configurations.

## Architecture
- `cli.py`: Central command dispatcher using `argparse`.
- `kiro_conv.py`: Handles complex mapping for Kiro CLI (tools, skills as resources, steering).
- `copilot_conv.py`: Aggregates knowledge into a single repository-wide instruction file for GitHub Copilot.

## Usage Principles
- Input: `.agent/` folder containing `agents/`, `skills/`, and `workflows/`.
- Output: Standardized formats for Kiro and Copilot.
- Smart Model Selection: Logic to use cheaper models for non-coding agents.
